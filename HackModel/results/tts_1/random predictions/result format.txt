This folder contain all the results generated from training and prediction testing of the 25 .csv files.
Result generated from each file is saved in an individual folder, with the name "FILEINDEX - TESTACCURACY".

Each file is trained using random 75% of data, and tested using the rest 25% of data.

Inside each folder there are 5 files:

>> A "FILEINDEX - result.txt" file with the number of entries in the data, number of iterations to reach absolute convergence, and the prediction test accuracy

>> A "FILEINDEX - Motion Sensor Observations.png" figure showing the probability of observing a "true" in the original motion sensor observations (original data)

>> A "FILEINDEX - Trained Occupancy States.png" figure showing the probability of the hidden occupancy states being "true", where the hidden occupancy states are generated after the training of data

>> A "FILEINDEX - Discrete Predictions.png" figure showing the predictions generated with the prediction testing (0 or 1)

>> A "FILEINDEX - Forward Probabilities.png" figure showing the probability of the next motion sensor observation being "true" during the predictions, which also leads to the conclusions in the Discrete Predicitons

Note that in all figures, the X-axis represents the hour of the day (0 to 48). The red line represents weekdays, and the blue line represent weekends.
